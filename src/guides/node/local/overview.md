# Overview

This section is aimed at helping you understand the process of preparing a local machine for use as a Rocket Pool node at home.


## Guides

[Selecting Staking Hardware](./hardware.md) shows a wide variety of viable hardware configurations for node operation, hopefully helping you find inspiration when picking what to get for yourself.

[Preparing a PC, Mini-PC, or NUC](./prepare-pc.md) walks you through the basic steps of installing and configuring the base Operating System on your machine to prepare it for life as a node.

[Preparing a Mac](./prepare-mac.md) is the same, but for macOS systems.

[Intro to Secure Shell (SSH)](../ssh.md) shows you how to use **SSH**, a popular remote-access tool for working with your node machine remotely and securely from a different machine (such as a laptop or desktop) so you don't have to interact with the node directly via a monitor and keyboard connected to it.
